# RECOGNITION OF THE GRAMMAR (a<sup>n</sup>b where n>=10) USING YACC
## Register Number :212222040048
## Date : 27/03/24

## AIM   
To write a YACC program to recognize the grammar a<sup>n</sup>b where n>=10.

## ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the variables a and b.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc â€“d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter a string as input and it is identified as valid or invalid.
 
## PROGRAM
```
%{
/* Definition section */
#include "y.tab.h"
%}

/* Rule Section */
%%
[aA] {return A;}
[bB] {return B;}
\n {return NL;}
. {return yytext[0];}
%%

int yywrap()
{
    return 1;
}
```
## OUTPUT 

![328386027-096cac81-e268-4e11-8849-5959749e9025](https://github.com/greffinaprem/19CS409-Compiler-Design-Lab/assets/119475603/48de4808-cbf5-48a6-aa5d-a3115dae118e)


## RESULT
The YACC program to recognize the grammar anb where n>=10 is executed successfully and the output is verified.
